### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Haoshi (Owen) Wu, a Grade 11 Student at Laurel Heights Secondary School! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning front and back-end web development, using HTML, Tailwind CSS, React, Flask, and MongoDB.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the realm of cryptography, as even though the concept is fascinating, I feel I would do things wrong.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects that I find fun such as game development, where I've made my games Objective: Survive and Sudoku Solver!

Thanks for reading this!
