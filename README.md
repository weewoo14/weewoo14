### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Haoshi (Owen) Wu, a Grade 10 Student at Laurel Heights Secondary School! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning various problem-solving techniques to help me in my journey of competitive programming!
My favorite data structure is a HashMap due to its versatility and helpfulness in various problems!

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with the realm of cryptography, as even though the concept is fascinating, I feel I would do things wrong.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects that I find fun such as game development, where I've made my game Objective: Survive and Sudoku Solver!

Thanks for reading this!
