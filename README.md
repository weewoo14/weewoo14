### Hi there 👋

I'm Haoshi (Owen) Wu, a Grade 12 Student at Laurel Heights Secondary School! 

🌱 I’m currently learning front and back-end web development, using HTML, Tailwind CSS, React, Flask, and MongoDB.

🤔 I’m looking for help with the realm of cryptography, as even though the concept is fascinating, I feel I would do things wrong.

🔭 I’m currently working on various projects that I find fun such as game development, where I've made my games Objective: Survive and Sudoku Solver!

Thanks for reading this!
